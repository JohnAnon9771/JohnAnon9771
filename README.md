  João Alves — a software craftsman 🧵

  I write software like someone building something to last.  
  I treat code like I treat the details of a handwritten letter.

## Manifesto of a Software Craftsman 🧶

> *I don't code to look smart.*  
> *I code so the next person reading it can breathe easy.*

- Good code doesn't guess. It talks.
- Method names are promises. Bad names are debt.
- Tests protect behavior. Clarity protects the mind.
- Market standards don't rule me. Purpose does.
- Minimalism isn't doing less. It's doing only what matters.
- I write software for humans — before machines.
